# Rutgers Bootcamp Challenge - Pandas Challenge

In this assignment, youâ€™ll create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

## Description

I'm the new Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district. In this capacity, I'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The analysis should align with the following results:
